==== IDE ( integrated development environment)

gen ai, agenti ai programme we need to 1 program language

python -- to learn we need to install some application 


ide -- user or developer write the code, debug the code & get output

popular ide -- 

	VS CODE & extension 
		GITHUB (4 month for gen ai & agentic ai)
		jupyter 
		spyder
		google colab


online team -- I proper wifi connect 

== vs code explanation 

Download from google & install as per your os 

install some extension for ds, da, ai, ml, genai, agentic ai, llm

the learner, experience who are very much slow in typing so please listen the classes only after the class I will share you the recording please follow 

after install the vs extension --> 
please google -- python 3.12 or 3.13 -- install that  
vs code -- terminal -- go to theat path location -- creat folder 

vs code -- how to install | we install extension to work gen ai & agentic ai project

we create .ipynb file -- we worked(tested all the code)
we create .py file -- we worked (tested all the code) 

appreciate the learne who completed 
the one who got error please to fix the code 
mac  user got issue 
===
extension of word -- .doc 
extension of pdf -- .pdf

	trakcing 

1- we create GitHub 
2- generative ai vs agentic ai 

	generative ai -- ai generate code , text, image, video, audio user need to take the code 
			work in vs code or any ide to build app for the project 

	agentic ai -- virtual developer or virtual agent write the code, debug, code compilation
			install framework, every thing done by virtual agent and give app for your 			project 

 	organization 10 developer require ( 3-4 developer ) agentic ai framework
		cuz of this comapy cost saving, automization , that's more lay off is goingon 
		

2010, 2017 -- recission was happened 
2025 onwards -- backfill once the recission has done 

	ai vs gen ai vs agentic ai 
	
	ai -- user or developer train the data( excel, imgae, video, audio) 
	gen ai -- user not train the data data trained by openai, google, meta, deepseek 
	agentic -- agents will connect to llm model + connect to webtools -- build agent to automize the project 


FULL STACK -- BACKEND + FRONTEND 

	BACKEDN -- GEN AI MODEL 
	FRONT END -- STREAMLIT , GRADIO

1- Google Classlink -- completed 
2- Confirmation of Software Installation - completed  
3- About Notes, Task, Project, Poc, Resume Project -- day wise I will give assignment 
4- Q & A 

world we have many programming language 
top 5 programin language in the world
 1- python 
 2- java
 3- golang

python -- db, cloud, scripting, ml, ai, genai, agenti ai, 
	
c -- doesnot support object 
c++ - doens support function 
python doesnot support android application, mobile device 
	rest of thing very powerfull

open source fantasting program -- python 

	python you cant build agenti ai project 

-- you are some one have 0 knowledge (thing to learn ) easy compare to java, c, c++ 
-- java 20 line of code | 4 line of code 
-- python is object oriented program 
-- python name comes 'complete monty python's flying circus' broadcasted in bbc channel 
-- java 1995 python 1989 
-- python was old programming lang then java 
-- 1989 no body used python 
-- python used heaviy from 2017 onward, ml world, 
-- java- childhoom ,.net, sql, -- old program
-- 2017 - 2020 ( ml jobs very scope)
  2020- 23 ( ai will rule the world)
 2023- 2024 ( generative ai, llm model, prompt engineer)
 2025 - agentic ai 
2020 -- quantum computing 

-- python pvm (python virtual machine) 
-- platform independent & no need to change the code for one platform to other platform 
	1 code ( window, mac, Linux) 
-- static constant & dynamic -- change based on the situation 
-- def system au | datatype| dta structure 

ANACONDA PYTHON --- BIG DATA, DATASCEINCE, ML, AI, 

python: hit enter -- system bydefault taken as 4 space
that's you can find nested loop ( nested loop) 


project -- company 

IDE -- integrated development environment 
	user can write the code, debug the code 
	vs code, jupyter, spyder 

Vs code with extension 
Anaconda -- Jupyter & Spyder
Google collab 


interpreter vs compiler 

execute the code line by line -- interpreter 
	piece of code - interprete 

compiler -- execeu entire code at once -- compilier 

does python -- compiler or interpreter or both 

== then get the google classrrom as soon as possible 
== I stated the program 

=== pointer ===

1- lerners exper or fresher if you joined session for 1st time I will take the back up class at last of session

_previous result 

====== 28th

PYTHON VARIABLE 

EVERY ONE HAS NAME

PYTHON ALSO HAS NAME 

NAME == (VARIABLE = IDENTIFIER = OBJECT)

syntax of varieb = (variable name = value)

a = 5 
a - variable
5 is the value 

value also called as datatype 
---
Rules to define variable -->
---

1- variable are case sensitive 
	nit = 5 | NIT which is wrong | nit 

2- variable doesnot start with digit but end with digit 

3- special character is not allowed except _ 

4- keywords are not define as variable 
	keyword = reserved hotel 


python we called the function  with . 
functions always ends with () 
id()

variable and function 

values are assigned to value 
function always ends with () 

family1(d, m) --> family1 function with 2argument or 2 parameter 
family2(d, m, s, d) --> family2 function with 4 argument or 4 parameter 

chatgpt model trained with billion of parameter that cpu macine are not working 
	gpu machine ( google colab) 

variable == value 
python variable we are completed 
python function ends with () 
function

=== 1st 

AGEDA ->

DataTypes  
Typecasting  
print()

1- download WinRAR or winzip from google 
2- download & Install this software 
3- 

gen ai  & agenti ai 

10th grade without

without python, ml, ai -- genai & agenti ai is highly impossible 
donot hypnto -- youutbe trailer 
background -- marketin 

syntax of variable = value 

variable -- object or identifer
value is called datatypes 

a = 5 

a is variable 
5 int value | int datatypes 

int - value without decimal is called int 
float - value with decimal is called float
	only e letter is allowed exponential 
	 
	value with decimal 

bool -- completed 


python when every you define true , false , none  T, F, N
'true'

int, float, bool 

complex -- other programming language we don't see complexdatatype only in pyton 

syntax -- a + bj ( only j letter is allowed not any other letter are alloed)

a - real part 
b - imaginary part 
j - squre root of -1 

complex use big 

int - value without decimal  a = 4

float - value with decimal (f = 102300.67)

bool - True or False ( when you add + - True -- 1 & False - 0 

complex -- 10 + 20J ( only j letter is allowed) 

=== string indexing 

forward indexing ( always begins with 0)
backward indexing (always begins with -1) 

slicing : -- print all element 

2: -- print element or value from 2nd index

:5 -- print element or value from start index till n-1 
	n-1 formula is always apply to right index 
2:10 -- print element or value from 2nd index ill 10-1 till 9th 


language == text 
when the text is large ( internet) 
ecosystem to crat or handle text from internet ( opneai, gemin) large language model 

if you work in with data ( data is excel ) -- machie learning 
if the data is image, text, video, audio -- artificial intelligence
	AI -- user or developer train some text -- AI project

data is automiatically train by open user no need to feed the text or image to mdod
	user just need to write the prompt -- gen ai project 
		gans 

llm + virtual agent == rather user write the code ( agent will write the code) - agentic ai

== basic python 
	variable 
	datatypes we are completed 

==== 2nd 
technical part -->
--
1- python type casting -- completed 
2- print() 

Instruction for 4 month session -->
--- 
3- tomorrow onwards who ever registerd you need to from the portal
4- update your regular works GitHub so that repo should be & also make linkedin powerfull 
5- question & answer today 


vehicle() -- 0 argument or 0 parameter 
car(swift) -- car function with 1 argument 
cars(swift, audi, bmw) -- cars function with 3 argument 


cast from all other data type to data type 


while we do type casting from other datatype to int()

complex is not possible & string with text is not possible 
rest of the datatypes are possible 


other datatype to int & float except text string, complex 
other datatype to bool & string no issue 
other datatype to complex ( should not pass 2 string ) & test string also not possible

print() -- very very important 

1- print result with string ( print with msg end user -- clarity) 

2- print format method  ( variable are not in {} but we define {} for the variable 

3- f-string short form (variable are define in {var}
	

=========
prompt engineer ( what are multile way to create prompt in python)
+
llm model api key 
+ 
prompt engineer parameter(temp = 0.2, top-p, top-k)

====  prompt engineer projects 


data| exce if you have no value then null -- fill null value ( code 


what ever document I am sharing to you theare are lot of research task has assigned to you 

you job is not to complex the task 
task is some where is align to real time work  

=== 

concept already create by python ( you don't want to change concept)
working professional -- you want change everying what if  like 
don't be researcher 
every company workin on project 
project no body used all the python code  

4 months -- you really enn and you will talk to the world 
you vs new ai world 


==== today is last day of the free classes
=== do not get new link when the class started 
	please get the link before 1hr or 2hr 
=== If you registered areef is shared the google classroom in whats app
== learning is learning for everyone ( usa, uk, mars, Jupiter, sun) 
== 4month ( 6yr topics) 
== everyday please revise atleast 1 hr even though you don't have time)
== you will drop in mid of classes
== live is always live 

if you have any question feel free to ask

python data structure -->

data type 
vs 
data structure
vs 
array
vs 
dataframe 


======
Data type - user define only 1 value || a =5, b = 5.5, c= 'nit' etc 
	
	int, float, bool, comp, string
	
Data structure -- user define more then 1 value 
			a1 = [1,2,3] b1 = ('a', 'b', 3.5)
	list, tuple, set, dict, range 

Matrix -- Array (1d, 2d , nd) 
	1d, 2d, nd, transpose, flatten etc 

Dataframe - table ( rows * columns) 
	company works with db -- collection of table (row*column) 

=====
scaler  == number 
vector == collection scaler 
matrix == collection of vector
tensor == collection of matrix 
===== 
package vs module vs function 
====
package == framework == library
	collection of module

module == collection of function
function == inbuild() | user define()


====
from dmart_store.cloting import jeans
dmart - pkg 
clothing - module 
jeans - function 

from sklearn.tree import decissiontreeclassifier

DATA STRUCTURE 
LIST == 
from tomorrow [] -- 


array - homogeneous 
list - heterogeneous

if you are typing is slow then please just listen the class ok team.

technical topic -- simple 

====9th 

tab on function-- disply list of inbuild function 
function call with . | variable will assigned with _ 

list is mutable | changeable 
once user define the value later user can change the values 

if you are new learner 0 knowledge 
======

pop() - index level remove element 
remove() -- remove the value based element wise 
mutable -- 

sorting is not possible when user declare multiple data types 
sort is possible only when user decare similar datatypes 

parameter tunning -- sytem given own parameter 
hyperparameter tunning -- user change the system parameter 

laptop - 11 os ( parameter)
laptop - 10 os (hyperparameter) 


during ml journey ml model accuracy will increase by using hypererparameter tunning 

LIST IS COMPLETE TODAY 

=== 

l = []
t = () 

list is mutable 
tuple is immutable 

==== 10th 

set -- {} {}

set some time act as mutable & also immutable 

when user pass same datatype then only order is allowed or else not 

do not compare java - python , 
c - python 
c++ - python 


data type 
data structure 
matrix 
table 
tensor 
scaler 
vector
tensor 

append() vs add() 
list() vs set() 

discard() & remove() 

discard() -- never through you error if element is not member of variable 
remove()== will through you error if element is not family member

union | = merge set
intersec & = common element
difference - = remove the common element display element from 1st variable only it wont print 
		element from 2nd variable 
symmetric difference ^ = skip commom elemenbt and print element for both set 


superset() == dad 
subset() == son 
disjoint() == neighbour

LIST -->
--
1- define with []
2- append() -- add the value at the end of the list 
3- copy() - copy from one list to another list 
4- multiple datatype in the list (heterogeneous) 
5- duplication is allowed 
6- list is growable 
7- clear() the value from the list 
8- using del keyword we can delate the variable 
9- insert() insert the value before index
10- pop()- remove value from the list by index wise if user didn't pass any argument 
		bydefault at last 
11- remove() - remove the value from the list 
12- reverse() - reverse the list 
13- extend() - extend for one list to another ( merging) 
14- sort() - ascending & descending sort when user declare similar datatypes 

== TUPLE 

1- Tuple duplication is allowed
2- Index & slicing is allowed 
3- Count() is allowed
4- Multiple datatype we can define

python ml, -- ai tools 
ai ( nlp, dl, nn )--- ai tools 
gen ai -- ai tools 
agentic ai -- ai tools 
after complete everytopics -- ai tools

string slicing
list slicing
array slicing
data frame slcing
slicing in machine learning 


when ever I am speakiong please listen first 
after class do all research 


reason for not understanding 

1- I am speaking you are thinking something
2- I am wile work or you may be you are doing what every brain is explanation  

===== 11th

LIST = [] TUPLE = () SET {}, DICT -- {}

format to define dictionary {keys:values}
most import goes keys rather then values 

list & dict is mutable ( you can what ever you want)
tuple is immutable 
set do not speak mutable or immutable (behave based on situation) 

4day on ds that's why dict become easy for you 



basic python 
advanced python 
oops python
	class 
	method
	object
	encapsulation
	inheritance
	polymorphism
	abstraction 

llm model -- you can call api key -- project are complete
why we are calling api key -- what is challengae 
organization -- any project -- without chanlange
more important goes to keys 

list, tuple, set, dict -- we are completed 

range () max user can define only 3 argument

1st argument - start
2nd argument - stop
3rd argument - step 

=== list vs tuple vs set vs dict vs range ( can you make comparsion sheet) 
=== future reference which helps to crake interview

==== 13th
for comparing the 2 variable we will be using relation operator 

logical operator 

and 
or 
not 

== NUMBER SYSTEM 

BINARY number system (base 2) - 0b
octal number system (base 8) - 0o
decimal number system (base 10) - 0x
hexadecimal number system (base 16) - 0xabcdef | a-10, b-11, c-12, d-13,e-14,f-15

if you are not understand this binary number system you cannot understand bitwise operator 

number - bit wise binary number syste
binary number system  - number
 
and 
bitwise and
or 
bitwise or 

xor -- xclusive or

function 

conditional statment 
	if 
	if else 
	if elif else 
	nested if 
	
in organization we should not write multiple if why ?
	 DEBUGGING IN PYCHARM 
It will check each and every condition even though not requred, memory execution wil be slow 

if use case has more then 1 condition 2 condtion ( nested if ) 
	
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/conditional-statements-in-python/
conditoional statement is completed 

This some thing you need to sit and work to build logic ()

 conditional statemeter we are completed

There is no project you can build without function 
Eda - foundation for ml 
eda with python for data cleaning 
eda integration to llm s 


function are divide into 2 part --> alwasy define with (): enter bydefaul it consider 4 spaces 

1- Inbuild()  -- print() len(), max(), min() , head(), tail(), etc 
2- user defned () -- always starts with def keyword 

def function_name(): 
	print('hello team')
function_name
function with argument 
function without argument 

whenever you are working on function make sure do not print print() as much as try to avodi id tab
----
function arguments -->
---
function argument categorise with 2 part -->

1- formal argument -- we will define the at the time of funcation defing 

2- actual argument -- while we call thefunction 
		positional argument -- done 
		keyword argument -- done 
		default argument -- done 
		variable length argument	 (arg) -- done 
		keyword variale lenght argument ( kwarg) -- keyword + variable lenght 

	
what ever i will teach you now that same concpet you will be using 
(operator overloading) which is the part of polymorphism ( many + form) 

==== 29th 
llm tools 
	paid one 
	free one 

1- ollama.com -- download the software & Install the software 
		if you system ram is 4gb then might it would be slow 
		make sure please check the size of the software from controll pannel 

2-  We check that size of the application 5.9 gb ( 4gb ram) it wont work 

3- chat gpt also provide wrong & inaccuracy responese guys ???

EDA ( explaratory data analysis) 
ML -- core subject 

Eda is foundation of  machine learning -- how ??? 

1- EDA technique is help to convert raw - clean -- ml model 
7 technique need to follow 

=================
0- Busines understanding  -- 
		bank, service, manuface, scm, fmcg,  product
		no business run with out customer | 
		all non technical job
		
1- Variable identification == (colum name in excel == variable == attribute)
				DV (y)
				IV(x1, x2, x3---)
				
2- univariate analysis
3- bivariate 	analysis
4- outlier treatment '
5- missing variable treatment 
6- variable imputation 
7- variable createion 
=====

1- Variable identification  
		Indepedent variable (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5---xn) = non target attribute = non predicted attribute 
		Dependent variable (y) -- target variable -- predicted variable 
		
family () -- 4 attribute 

	dad ( govt employ) -- dependent variable   ( y) | 
	mom ( hose wife) -- independent variable (x1) 
	son (4th ) -- independent variable (x2)
	daughter (3rd)  -- independent (x3)
	
math formul (y = x1 + x2 + x3 ) 
this formula ml == (y = m1x1+m2x2 +m3x3)


how eda is connected to machine learning -->

ML technique 3 part 
			Regression  -- 
					dependent variable is continuous  this is called regression 
				example -- petrol price 
									gold price 
									stock price 
									vehicel price 
									crypto price 
									land price
									ticket price
									flight price 
									electricity bill price 
									house price 
Regression model -->
		simple linear regression 
		multiple linear regression 
		polynomial regression 
		lasso regression 
		ridge regression 
		svr regression 
		knn regression 
		time series 
									

			Classification  -- dependent variable is binary or category 
						yes | no -- 1 | 0
						win| loos 
						+ve reve | -ve review 
						crash | not crash
						hot | cold 
						fraud | non fraud 
						spam | non speam
						+Ve | -ve 
						pass | fail 
						up | down 
						
classification algorithm -->
		logistic regression  ( prob algo)
		svm 
		knn
		naive bayes ( beysian theorem)
		dt 
		rf 
			
					
Clustering -- -100 | rating  -5  | grouping
		pca ( principal compoenenet analysis)
		k means clustering 
		
=== ml will be completed 


ML 
	SUPERVISED LEARNING == STRUCTURE DATA == LABELED DATA 
			REGRESSION - dv is continus ( regression algorithm)
			CLASSIFICATION -- dv is binary or category 
structure data will store in (strucutre database = sql db - rdbms)  ( mysql, postgre, oracle
			
			
			
	UNSUPERVISED LEARNING == UNSTRCUTURE DATA = UNLABLE DATA 
			CLUSTERING ( no  dependent variable) groupinng
unstructured data store in unstructure db == no sql db -- non relation dbbm 
		mongo db, cassandar, hbase 
		
vector db ( llm model text are store vector format) 
	RAG MODEL 
			pinecond, faiss, chroma, milvus, qdrant, 
	
			
REINFORCEMENT LEARNING 
			model will interact climat, sitatuation 
			agents will comes in to her
			

1- variable identification	
					IV (x1, x2--
					DV (y)
					relavant attribute  ( every time we need to build the model with relavant attribute) 
					irrelavant attribute ( we need to remove the irrelaven attribute ) 
					
==== 31st
1- Variable identification == (colum name in excel == variable == attribute)
				DV (y)
				IV(x1, x2, x3---)
				
2- univariate analysis  - completed 
		
3- bivariate 	analysis
		corelation -- relation amoung 2 attribute is called corelation 
				+Ve corr ( 0 to 1)
				-ve corr (-1 to 0)
					no corr  ( 0) 
				
		range of the corelation -1 to 1
		
4- outlier treatment 
		we detect outlier based on some graphs  
		this outlier will impact ml algorithms 
		real time you cannot remove outlier but we can adjust by add prob function 
		prob func is called sigmoid curve 
			
5- Missing value treatment 
					
In datatset 2 types of variabe 
			numerical & categorical 
	numerical -- number | categorical -- text 
		
in the dataset if numerical values are missing 
		if numerical datas are missing then we need to implement mean, median, mode strategy 

 how to fill missing value in your existing project ?
	If numerical value are missing -- mean, median, mode
	If categorical value are missing -- mode & knn startegy 
	
6 & 7 -->
	variable createion & variable transformation 
	
TRANSFORMER also called as IMPUTATION TECHNIQUE 

		dummy variable or one hot encoder - convert categorical data to numerical data
							no. of classes == no. of classifier 
		labelencoder - covert categorical value to numerb 0,1,2,3--
==== EDA IS COMPLETED 

=== 2nd 


str.replace(r'\w')

non word character -

eda -- we have complete only 1 technique
	missing value treatment 
			numerical value  -- mean, median, mode 
			categoical value -- mode 

==== 3rd 
From 12th onwards --- session is going to back to 5:30pm 
eda with llm --- data analyss use llm to automise 

monday -- statistc 


emp data - raw with expresession 
clean data -- which we removed all noisy character |, ;
clean_data -- that data is store in memory  
	clean data -- clean datat from memory to system 
			from the syste 

what are the steps to follow for project data cleaning -- 

eda out of 7 techniques 
		1- missing value treatment 
					numerical & categorical 
		2- univariate analysis
		3- outlier treatmet  
		4- bivariate treatment ( +ve corelation) 
		5- variable identification 
		6 & 7-- variable creation & variable imputation we been discussed
