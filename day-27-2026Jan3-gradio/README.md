## What Is Gradio?

**Gradio** is an open-source Python library that allows you to quickly build web-based user interfaces for machine learning models, APIs, and any Python functions—without writing frontend code (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).

It is widely used for:
- Rapid ML/AI prototyping
- Model demos and experimentation
- Interactive tools for data science and GenAI
- Sharing applications with teams or stakeholders
