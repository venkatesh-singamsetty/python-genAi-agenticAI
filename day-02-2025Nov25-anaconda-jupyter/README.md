## 5. Gen AI vs Agentic AI

### Generative AI (GenAI)
- Creates new content  
- Works based on prompts  
- Examples: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Midjourney  

### Agentic AI
- AI that can plan, decide, and take actions  
- Works in loops: observe → think → act → learn  
- Examples: AI automation agents, Bedrock Agents, LangChain Agents  

**Difference:**  
GenAI = Generates content  
Agentic AI = Performs actions autonomously
