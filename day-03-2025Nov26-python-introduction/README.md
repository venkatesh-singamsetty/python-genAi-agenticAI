# More details

## 1. Python Introduction

### Installation

Ensure that Anaconda or Python is installed on your system.

### Programming Experience

If you do not know any programming language, Python is the best language to begin with because of its simplicity.

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language.

**Key Points:**

* **Creator:** Guido van Rossum
* **Created:** 1989
* **First Release:** February 20, 1991
* **Name Origin:** Inspired by the BBC comedy show *"Monty Python’s Flying Circus"*

Python incorporates ideas from C, C++, Java, and UNIX shell scripting, making it powerful, flexible, and easy to learn.

### Features

* Large standard library
* Free and open-source
* Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
* Dynamically typed
* Expressive and readable syntax
* Rich ecosystem of libraries: NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, etc.

### Industry Popularity

Python dominates:

* Machine Learning
* Artificial Intelligence
* Data Science
* Big Data
* Automation & Scripting
* Web Development
* IoT
* Cybersecurity
* Generative AI & LLMs

**Companies using Python:** Google, NASA, Netflix, Meta, Uber, Reddit, Microsoft, and many more.

### Where Python is NOT the best

* Mobile App Development
* High-performance system-level programming

## 2. Flavors of Python

| Implementation      | Based On | Description                            |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **CPython**         | C        | Default and most common implementation |
| **Jython**          | Java     | Runs on JVM                            |
| **IronPython**      | .NET     | Runs on .NET CLR                       |
| **PyPy**            | RPython  | JIT-compiled, faster execution         |
| **Anaconda Python** | CPython  | Includes packages for data science     |

## 4. Tools to Write Python Code

### IDE Options

* **VS Code** (recommended)
* **PyCharm** (best for development)
* **Jupyter Notebook** (data science)
* **Spyder**
* **IDLE** (bundled with Python)

### What is an IDE?

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) supports:

* Code editing
* Running and debugging
* Building applications

## 5. Python Interpreter

A Python interpreter executes code *line by line* and converts it into machine-understandable instructions.

Example usage:

```
python file.py
```

### Interpreter vs Compiler

| Interpreter                | Compiler                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Executes code line-by-line | Translates entire program |
| Slower execution           | Faster execution          |
| Easy to debug              | Harder to debug           |
| Python, JavaScript         | C, C++, Java              |

Python internally compiles to **bytecode**, which is executed by the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**.
