Create a complete Python application using Streamlit for booking flights from Hyderabad (HYD) to Goa (GOI) with the following requirements:

1. The app should have a clean UI with:
   - A title and short description.
   - Date selector for departure and return dates.
   - A table or card-style list showing flight options.

2. Features required:
   - Show at least 3–5 flight options for Hyderabad → Goa.
   - Show at least 3–5 options for Goa → Hyderabad (return).
   - Each flight option should include:
        • Airline name
        • Departure time
        • Price
        • Duration (optional)
   - User should select one going flight and one return flight.
   - Automatically calculate total price.

3. When the user clicks "Book Ticket":
   - Show booking summary in a nice layout.
   - Include:
        • Departure date, return date
        • Selected flights with prices
        • Total amount
        • Success message

4. Use Pandas DataFrame internally to store the flight lists.
5. Use Streamlit components like st.radio, st.button, st.success, st.subheader, st.columns, etc.
6. The final code should be fully runnable as `streamlit run flight_app.py`.

Generate the full Python code in one piece without placeholders.
