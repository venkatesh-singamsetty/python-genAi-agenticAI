**Analysis:**

*   **Birth Rate:** The birth rate is 195.000000, indicating a relatively high birth rate. This suggests a population with a relatively high number of births per unit of population.
*   **Internet Users:** The internet users are 195.000000, indicating a significant number of internet users. This suggests a large and active population with a considerable online presence.
*   **Mean Age:** The mean age is 42.076471, indicating a relatively young population. This suggests a population with a relatively young age relative to their overall size.
*   **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation is 29.030788, indicating a relatively uniform distribution of population size. This suggests that the population is reasonably large and relatively uniform in size.
*   **Minimum Age:** The minimum age is 7.900000, indicating a relatively young population. This suggests a population with a relatively young age relative to their overall size.

**Insights:**
